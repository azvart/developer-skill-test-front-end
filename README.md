# Labzone - FE Developer Skill Test

A simple test app to ascertain developer skill-level.

The challenge is to create a basic app using HTML, CSS, JavasScript - React.js and the Flickr API.

The app should demonstate your ability to set up a React App, load in some photos from Flickr (JSON format) and display the photo, name and description in a card layout. The images should be clickable and link to the content. The app should have a header and a footer and ideally be responsive.

Bonus points will be awarded for a working search box, loading more photos on scroll and any other visual improvements or animations that you would like to add.

Please clone this repository and create a branch and then push the content to the remote when you are done.

You can register for an API key [here](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/).

More documentation on the API can be found on [this link](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).

Pixel perfect mockup to design is a real focus for us at Labzone, the mockup for the test is as follows:
